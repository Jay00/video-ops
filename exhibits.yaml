# Comment: This is a YAML file used to list the exhibits you wish to create.
# Describe Clips that you want to cut, with the start and end times.

# Time Stamps: Note that you can use two different time unit formats: sexagesimal (HOURS:MM:SS.MILLISECONDS, as in 01:23:45.678),
# or in seconds. If a fraction is used, such as 02:30.05, this is interpreted as "5 100ths of a second", not as frame 5.
# For instance, 02:30.5 would be 2 minutes, 30 seconds, and a half a second, which would be the same as using 150.5 in seconds.
