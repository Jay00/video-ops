# Comment: This is a YAML file used to list the exhibits you wish to create.
# Describe Clips that you want to cut, with the start and end times.

# output_directory: REQUIRED (path to the directory where clips should be saved to)
# label_font_color: "#32b1ac" # default font color for all labels in hex (light blue)
# clips:
#   - label: REQUIRED "Ex. 14A" (This will become the file name) This label will be in the file path. Do not use reserved characters. (Reserved Chars = <>:"/\|?*)
#     source: REQUIRED "./test/a.mp4"
#     start: REQUIRED "00:00:00.000" TIMESTAMP
#     stop: REQUIRED "00:00:05.100" TIMESTAMP (*Recomended that you add 100 milliseconds to capture last frame of intended clip)
#     remove_audio: OPTIONAL (true or *false) (default is false)
#     label_postion: OPTIONAL (*bottom_middle, bottom_left, bottom_right, top_left, top_middle, top_right) (default is bottom_middle)
#     label_display: OPTIONAL (*true or false) Mark false to remove the label (default is true)
#     label_font_color: OPTIONAL (hex color) (default is #38b1fc)

# Time Stamps: Note that you can use two different time unit formats: sexagesimal (HOURS:MM:SS.MILLISECONDS, as in 01:23:45.678),
# or in seconds. If a fraction is used, such as 02:30.05, this is interpreted as "5 100ths of a second", not as frame 5.
# For instance, 02:30.5 would be 2 minutes, 30 seconds, and a half a second, which would be the same as using 150.5 in seconds.
